# Pulmonary Fibrosis

<img style="float: right;" src="./img/ct_scan.jpeg" width="200">

This project's goal is to predict a patient's severity of decline in lung function based on 
their CT scans of lungs. With good accuracy of prediction, patients and their families would
better understand their prognosis when they are first diagnosed with this incurable lung disease.
Improved severity detection would also positively impact treatment trial design and accelerate 
the clinical development of novel treatments.
